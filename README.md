## 🎪 Fun Development Notes
- Built with ❤️ and probably too much coffee ☕
- Every animation is hand-crafted with the precision of a Swiss watch ⌚
- The code is cleaner than Kunal's video edits (and that's saying something!) ✨
- Kunal can edit Hollywood-level videos but struggled with Vercel deployment... so he called backup! 🆘😅
- Special thanks to the friend who saved the day with deployment magic ✨🚀
- Warning: This portfolio may cause other designers to question their life choices �

*P.S. - Kunal makes magic happen on screen, but when it comes to deployment... well, that's what friends are for!* 😄🤝
